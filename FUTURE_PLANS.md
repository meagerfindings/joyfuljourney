# Future Plans - Joyful Journey

## Overview

This document outlines the feature roadmap for Joyful Journey, based on analysis of the discontinued Legacy of Love/Legacy Journal app. Our goal is to create a comprehensive family memory preservation platform that can serve as a modern replacement for these beloved apps.

Legacy of Love/Legacy Journal was described as "the world's #1 person-to-person journaling app" - a digital hope chest for families to capture memories, leave lessons, and preserve the moments that might otherwise fade with time.
